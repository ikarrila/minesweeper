# Minesweeper
A school project to learn the basics of Python


Haravasto.py and the sprites are not by me, the rest is.
To get the game to download the graphics you should change the path on line 342 in the miinaharava.py file.

This is the first project I had in Uni and is originally from the first semester of 2017.
